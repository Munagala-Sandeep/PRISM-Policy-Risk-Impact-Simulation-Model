PRISM (Policy Risk & Impact Simulation Model) is a policy analysis and simulation platform designed to evaluate the potential risks, impacts, and outcomes of public policies **before** they are implemented in the real world.

The goal of PRISM is to help policymakers, researchers, and analysts make informed decisions by simulating policy effects in advance, reducing unintended harm, financial waste, and delayed corrections.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional policy-making faces several challenges:

- Policy impact analysis is slow and may take weeks or months  
- It is expensive and often depends on consultants and reports  
- Real-world impacts are usually discovered only after policy rollout  
- Late corrections can cause economic loss and regional or social harm  

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

PRISM addresses these issues by providing a **data-driven policy simulation environment** that:

- Predicts the impact of policies before implementation  
- Compares multiple policies (Policy A vs Policy B)  
- Identifies risks and vulnerable regions or groups  
- Generates an overall impact score  
- Suggests mitigation strategies to reduce negative outcomes  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Policy Impact Scoring**  
  Calculates an overall impact score based on multiple social and economic factors.

- **Policy Comparison**  
  Allows comparison between two or more policies to understand which performs better.

- **Risk Identification**  
  Detects high-risk areas, regions, or beneficiary groups.

- **Mitigation Suggestions**  
  Provides improvement strategies such as phased rollout or alternative funding options.

- **Simple & Explainable Results**  
  Outputs are easy to understand, making the system usable even for non-technical users.

## 🧪 Methodology (High-Level)

1. Policy details are provided as input  
2. Key impact factors are identified  
3. Each factor is assigned a weight  
4. Impact scores are calculated  
5. Risks and affected regions are analyzed  
6. Mitigation strategies are suggested  
7. Policies are compared and final insights are generated
